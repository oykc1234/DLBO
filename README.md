## Abstract

Traditional optimization methods often face the problem of local optima, where the optimization process may get trapped in a local optimum, making it difficult to find the global optimal solution. Additionally, these methods tend to have low computational efficiency, especially when dealing with large-scale and complex problems, leading to high time and resource consumption. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative metaheuristic algorithmâ€”**Dead Leaf Butterfly Optimizer (DLBO)**. 

Inspired by the behavior of dead leaf butterflies, DLBO mimics their ability to protect themselves through color changes and camouflage, as well as altering the color of their dorsal surface by spreading their wings to ward off predators. The dead leaf butterfly hides itself from predators by mimicking the shape and color of dead leaves. When threatened, it spreads its wings to reveal vibrant colors and patterns, creating a visual contrast to deter and surprise enemies. The combination of camouflage and deterrence helps the dead leaf butterfly survive.

DLBO introduces a new optimization method that effectively avoids getting stuck in local optima and enhances global search capabilities.

## Features

- Avoids local optima traps
- Efficient global search capability
